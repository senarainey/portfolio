Hi, my name is Sena Rainey, and I'm a graphic designer from Winchester, VA. In relation to web design, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design and bootstrap. I am also proficient in Premiere Pro, in which I do short videos about web design.  I am currently learning Dreamweaver and WordPress. 

<p class="blocktext"><center><h2>About This Site</h2></center>
This website was created as an assignment for the Web Design for Everybody Capstone, where I had to create a portfolio either from scratch or using a framework. I chose to do this site on gardening from scratch to show what I learned using  one of my hobbies as an example. It took me a while to do this site, because of recent life events like my mom's death on July 6, 2021. However, I decided to finish it, because I want earn a certificate for the Web Design for Everybody specialization.
